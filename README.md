# LLM From Scratch

(The goal is educational, not production-focused)
This repository documents my journey of building a **Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch**, focusing on understanding and implementing the core ideas behind modern language models rather than relying on high-level frameworks.

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧
